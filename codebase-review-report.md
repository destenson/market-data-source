## Conclusion

Market Data Source has strong architectural foundations and comprehensive feature planning, but **critical compilation issues prevent publication**. The codebase demonstrates good design principles with 20 completed PRPs and extensive functionality, but integration testing is completely broken due to crate resolution problems.

**Immediate Priority**: Execute PRP-21 to resolve compilation failures and quality issues. This is a prerequisite for all other publication activities and will unlock the ability to properly validate the full feature set.

**Publication Timeline**: With PRP-21 completed, the project could be publication-ready within 2-3 weeks following PRPs 22-27. The foundation is solid; the execution needs to catch up.

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Cannot recommend publication in current state due to fundamental build system issues. However, these appear to be solvable technical problems rather than architectural flaws.
