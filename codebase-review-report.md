## Technical Debt Priorities

1. **CI Build Dependencies**: ~~CRITICAL - Linux CI broken~~ **RESOLVED**
   - ~~Missing `fontconfig` system library breaks Python wheel builds~~
   - **FIXED**: Added `fontconfig libfontconfig1-dev` to all CI workflows
   - Estimated effort: **COMPLETED**

2. **Memory Optimization**: LOW - Build process enhancement
   - Requires `-j 1` flag for full feature compilation
   - Consider feature subset builds for CI/CD
   - Estimated effort: Configuration only

3. **Integration Test Enhancement**: LOW - Test coverage improvement
   - 1/4 integration tests requires export features
   - Consider feature-specific test organization
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 hours

4. **Unwrap() Reduction**: MEDIUM - Long-term maintenance
   - 179 unwrap() calls (not blocking publication)
   - Gradual replacement with expect() or proper error handling
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days (non-blocking)

5. **Documentation Enhancement**: LOW - Community polish
   - API documentation expansion
   - More comprehensive examples
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 days
