# Market Data Source

Market Data Source is a rust library for fetching and processing market data from various financial APIs. It provides a unified interface to access real-time and historical market data, making it easier for developers to integrate market data into their applications.

One of its key features is its extensible architecture, allowing users to easily add support for new data sources as needed.

Another key feature is realistic data generation, enabling users to simulate market conditions and test their trading strategies without risking real capital. It includes various algorithms to generate synthetic market data that mimics real-world behavior. It also supports customization of data generation parameters to fit specific testing scenarios.

## Features

- Configurable synthetic market data generation
- Support for OHLC candles and tick data
- Random walk with drift algorithm
- CSV export functionality for data analysis
- Deterministic generation with seed support
- Streaming generation for large datasets
- Extensible architecture for adding new algorithms

## Getting Started

To use Market Data Source in your Rust project, add the following dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
market-data-source = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["csv_export", "serde"] }
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use Market Data Source to generate synthetic market data:

```rust
use market_data_source::{MarketDataGenerator, GeneratorConfig};

fn main() {
    // Create a generator with default configuration
    let mut generator = MarketDataGenerator::new();
    
    // Generate 10 OHLC candles
    let candles = generator.generate_series(10);
    
    for candle in &candles[..3] {
        println!("{:?}", candle);
    }
    
    // Create a generator with custom configuration
    let config = GeneratorConfig::builder()
        .starting_price(100.0)
        .volatility(0.02)  // 2% volatility
        .trend_strength(0.001)  // Slight upward trend
        .seed(42)  // For reproducible results
        .build();
    
    let mut custom_generator = MarketDataGenerator::with_config(config);
    let custom_candles = custom_generator.generate_series(5);
}
```

### CSV Export

Export generated data to CSV files for analysis in Excel, pandas, or other tools:

```rust
use market_data_source::{MarketDataGenerator, ConfigBuilder};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let config = ConfigBuilder::new()
        .starting_price(100.0)
        .volatility(0.02)
        .seed(42)
        .build()?;
    
    let mut generator = MarketDataGenerator::with_config(config)?;
    
    // Generate and export OHLC data to CSV
    generator.generate_to_csv_ohlc(100, "market_data.csv")?;
    
    // For large datasets, use streaming to save memory
    generator.stream_generate_to_csv_ohlc(10000, "large_dataset.csv")?;
    
    // Export tick data
    generator.generate_to_csv_ticks(1000, "tick_data.csv")?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Current Status
