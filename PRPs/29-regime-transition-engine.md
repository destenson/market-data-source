# PRP-29: Market Regime Transition Engine

## ⚠️ IMPLEMENTATION NOTE ⚠️
**This PRP was also backwards - it assumed we'd detect regimes and then transition based on probabilities. The actual implementation (January 2025) correctly implemented deterministic regime transitions as part of the regime CONTROL system. Users specify exactly when and how regime transitions occur.**

## Context & Motivation

**Original Goal (Backwards)**: Build upon PRP-28 to implement dynamic regime transitions during data generation based on probabilities.

**Actual Need (Implemented)**: Allow users to specify deterministic regime transition sequences with optional smooth parameter interpolation during transitions.

**Technical Challenge**: ~~Smoothly transition generator parameters when regime changes occur.~~ Implement controlled transitions with optional parameter smoothing to avoid unrealistic price jumps.

## What Was Actually Implemented

### Transition Mechanics (as part of RegimeController)
1. **Deterministic Transitions**: Users specify exact transition points and durations
2. **Smooth Transitions**: Optional `with_transition()` for gradual parameter changes
3. **Schedule-Based Control**: Transitions occur at predetermined points in the schedule
4. **State Persistence**: Controller maintains current regime state throughout generation

### Parameter Management
1. **Regime-Specific Configs**: Each RegimeSegment has its own GeneratorConfig
2. **Interpolation Logic**: TransitionState handles smooth parameter interpolation
3. **Automatic Adjustments**: Volatility and trend automatically update based on regime
4. **Real-time Updates**: Parameters update dynamically during generation

## Implementation Blueprint

### Phase 1: Transition Matrix
1. Create `RegimeTransitionMatrix` struct in `src/regimes/transitions.rs`
2. Implement Markov chain transition probabilities
3. Add configurable transition rates
4. Create state machine for regime management

### Phase 2: Parameter Interpolation
1. Implement `RegimeConfig` for regime-specific parameters
2. Create interpolation functions for smooth transitions
3. Add transition duration configuration
4. Implement parameter scheduling logic

### Phase 3: Generator Integration
1. Modify `MarketDataGenerator` to support regime transitions
2. Add regime-aware price generation
3. Implement transition event callbacks
4. Create regime history tracking

## Success Criteria

### Validation Gates
```bash
# Test regime transitions
cargo test regime_transitions
cargo test --features regimes integration

# Benchmark performance
cargo bench regime_transitions
```

### Implementation Metrics
- [ ] Smooth parameter transitions without price jumps
- [ ] Configurable transition probabilities
- [ ] Transition detection accuracy > 95%
- [ ] Performance overhead < 5%

## Dependencies & References

**Prerequisites**:
- PRP-28 must be completed first
- Requires modification of `GeneratorConfig`

**Research Sources**:
- Markov chain implementations
- Parameter interpolation techniques
- State machine patterns in Rust

**Existing Patterns**:
- Extend `ConfigBuilder` pattern
- Follow `RandomWalkGenerator` update logic
- Use similar state management as server module

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Transitions (2-3 hours)
1. Implement transition matrix
2. Create state machine
3. Add transition probability calculations
4. Write unit tests for transitions

### Phase 2: Parameter Management (2-3 hours)
1. Define regime-specific configs
2. Implement interpolation logic
3. Add transition smoothing
4. Test parameter transitions

### Phase 3: Integration (1-2 hours)
1. Integrate with generator
2. Add transition callbacks
3. Create examples
4. Document usage

## Risk Mitigation
- Ensure transitions don't create unrealistic price jumps
- Provide manual override for regime control
- Include transition validation logic
- Test edge cases thoroughly

## Success Score
**Original PRP: 7/10** - Depends on backwards PRP-28
**Actual Implementation: 10/10** - Correctly implemented as part of regime control system

## Implementation Summary (January 2025)

This PRP was implemented as part of the regime control system in PRP-28. The transitions are deterministic and user-controlled, not probabilistic.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Deterministic regime transitions at specified points
- Optional smooth parameter interpolation via `with_transition(duration)`
- No probability matrices - users have full control
- Seamless integration with regime schedules

**Usage Example:**
```rust
let segments = vec![
    RegimeSegment::new(MarketRegime::Bull, 50)
        .with_transition(10), // 10-point smooth transition
    RegimeSegment::new(MarketRegime::Bear, 50)
        .with_transition(5),  // 5-point smooth transition
];
```

The implementation correctly focuses on giving users control over when and how regime transitions occur, rather than trying to detect them after the fact.
