# PRP-28: Market Regime Detection Foundation

## Context & Motivation

**Integration Goal**: Establish the foundation for detecting market regimes (bull, bear, sideways) in the synthetic data generation library.

**User Requirement**: Enable the generator to identify and track current market regime based on price movements and volatility patterns.

**Technical Challenge**: Implement efficient regime detection algorithms that can classify market states in real-time.

## Requirements

### Core Regime Detection
1. **State Classification**: Identify bull, bear, and sideways market states
2. **Detection Algorithms**: Implement rule-based and statistical methods
3. **Performance Metrics**: Track regime accuracy and transition detection
4. **Real-time Processing**: Efficient computation for streaming data

### Technical Implementation
1. **Moving Average Analysis**: Use SMA/EMA crossovers for trend detection
2. **Volatility Clustering**: Identify high/low volatility regimes
3. **Return Distribution**: Analyze return patterns for regime classification
4. **State Persistence**: Track regime duration and transitions

## Implementation Blueprint

### Phase 1: Core Detection Module
1. Create `src/regimes/mod.rs` for regime detection functionality
2. Define `MarketRegime` enum with Bull, Bear, Sideways states
3. Implement `RegimeDetector` trait for different detection strategies
4. Add rule-based detector using price movements and thresholds

### Phase 2: Statistical Methods
1. Implement rolling window statistics calculator
2. Add volatility-based regime classification
3. Create return distribution analyzer
4. Implement regime transition probability matrix

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Integrate regime detection into `MarketDataGenerator`
2. Add regime tracking to generated data
3. Create regime-aware data generation modes
4. Add regime metrics to export functionality

## Success Criteria

### Validation Gates
```bash
# Rust validation
cargo test --features regimes
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check

# Unit tests pass
cargo test regime_detection
```

### Implementation Metrics
- [ ] Regime detection accuracy > 80% on known patterns
- [ ] Processing time < 1ms per detection
- [ ] Support for customizable detection parameters
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests with > 90% coverage

## Dependencies & References

**Research Sources**:
- Hidden Markov Models for regime detection
- Rule-based peak/trough detection algorithms
- Volatility clustering patterns

**Rust Libraries**:
- Consider `augurs` crate for changepoint detection
- Use `rust_decimal` for precise calculations
- Leverage existing statistics in `rand_distr`

**Existing Patterns**:
- Follow module structure from `src/algorithms/`
- Use builder pattern like `ConfigBuilder`
- Implement similar to `RandomWalkGenerator`

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 hours)
1. Create regime module structure
2. Define core types and traits
3. Implement basic rule-based detector
4. Add unit tests for regime classification

### Phase 2: Enhancement (2-3 hours)
1. Add statistical regime detection
2. Implement volatility-based classification
3. Create regime transition tracking
4. Add comprehensive test coverage

### Phase 3: Integration (1-2 hours)
1. Integrate with generator
2. Add regime export capabilities
3. Create example usage
4. Document API and usage patterns

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with simple rule-based detection before complex statistics
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing generator
- Provide configurable detection sensitivity
- Include comprehensive validation tests

## Success Score
**8/10** - Well-defined scope with clear implementation path based on established patterns in the codebase.
