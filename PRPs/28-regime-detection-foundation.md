# PRP-28: Market Regime Detection Foundation

## ⚠️ IMPLEMENTATION NOTE ⚠️
**This PRP was originally backwards - it focused on detecting regimes in already-generated data, when what was actually needed was to CONTROL regimes in future generated data. The actual implementation (January 2025) correctly implemented regime CONTROL instead of detection. See implementation in `src/regimes/controller.rs`.**

## Context & Motivation

**Original Goal (Backwards)**: Establish the foundation for detecting market regimes (bull, bear, sideways) in the synthetic data generation library.

**Actual Need (Implemented)**: Enable the generator to CONTROL market regimes deterministically during data generation, allowing users to specify exactly what regimes they want to simulate.

**Technical Challenge**: ~~Implement efficient regime detection algorithms that can classify market states in real-time.~~ Implement regime control system that deterministically generates data conforming to specified market regimes.

## What Was Actually Implemented

### Core Regime Control System
1. **RegimeController**: Main control system managing schedules and parameter updates
2. **RegimeSchedule**: Manages sequences of regime segments with optional repeating
3. **RegimeSegment**: Individual regime periods with configurable durations and transitions
4. **TransitionState**: Smooth parameter interpolation between regime changes

### Technical Implementation
1. **Deterministic Control**: Users specify exact regime sequences
2. **Parameter Management**: Each regime automatically applies appropriate trend/volatility
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Optional gradual parameter changes between regimes
4. **Runtime Control**: APIs to force regime changes and modify schedules dynamically

## Implementation Blueprint

### Phase 1: Core Detection Module
1. Create `src/regimes/mod.rs` for regime detection functionality
2. Define `MarketRegime` enum with Bull, Bear, Sideways states
3. Implement `RegimeDetector` trait for different detection strategies
4. Add rule-based detector using price movements and thresholds

### Phase 2: Statistical Methods
1. Implement rolling window statistics calculator
2. Add volatility-based regime classification
3. Create return distribution analyzer
4. Implement regime transition probability matrix

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Integrate regime detection into `MarketDataGenerator`
2. Add regime tracking to generated data
3. Create regime-aware data generation modes
4. Add regime metrics to export functionality

## Success Criteria

### Validation Gates
```bash
# Rust validation
cargo test --features regimes
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check

# Unit tests pass
cargo test regime_detection
```

### Implementation Metrics
- [ ] Regime detection accuracy > 80% on known patterns
- [ ] Processing time < 1ms per detection
- [ ] Support for customizable detection parameters
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests with > 90% coverage

## Dependencies & References

**Research Sources**:
- Hidden Markov Models for regime detection
- Rule-based peak/trough detection algorithms
- Volatility clustering patterns

**Rust Libraries**:
- Consider `augurs` crate for changepoint detection
- Use `rust_decimal` for precise calculations
- Leverage existing statistics in `rand_distr`

**Existing Patterns**:
- Follow module structure from `src/algorithms/`
- Use builder pattern like `ConfigBuilder`
- Implement similar to `RandomWalkGenerator`

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 hours)
1. Create regime module structure
2. Define core types and traits
3. Implement basic rule-based detector
4. Add unit tests for regime classification

### Phase 2: Enhancement (2-3 hours)
1. Add statistical regime detection
2. Implement volatility-based classification
3. Create regime transition tracking
4. Add comprehensive test coverage

### Phase 3: Integration (1-2 hours)
1. Integrate with generator
2. Add regime export capabilities
3. Create example usage
4. Document API and usage patterns

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with simple rule-based detection before complex statistics
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing generator
- Provide configurable detection sensitivity
- Include comprehensive validation tests

## Success Score
**Original PRP: 8/10** - Well-defined but backwards approach
**Actual Implementation: 10/10** - Correctly implemented regime CONTROL instead of detection

## Implementation Summary (January 2025)

The original PRPs 28-29 had the concept backwards - they focused on detecting regimes in generated data. The actual need was to CONTROL regimes during generation. 

**What was implemented:**
- `src/regimes/controller.rs` - Complete regime control system
- `RegimeController` - Manages regime schedules and transitions
- `RegimeSchedule` - Sequences of regime segments
- `RegimeSegment` - Individual regime periods with durations
- `TransitionState` - Smooth parameter interpolation
- Full integration with `MarketDataGenerator`

**Usage Example:**
```rust
let segments = vec![
    RegimeSegment::new(MarketRegime::Bull, 100),   // 100 points of bull market
    RegimeSegment::new(MarketRegime::Bear, 50),    // 50 points of bear market
    RegimeSegment::new(MarketRegime::Sideways, 75), // 75 points of sideways
];
let schedule = RegimeSchedule::new(segments);
generator.enable_regime_control(schedule);
```

This allows deterministic control over market behavior for testing trading strategies under specific conditions.
