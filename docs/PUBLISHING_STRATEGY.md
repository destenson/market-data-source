### 3. Publish to PyPI
```bash
# Install twine if needed
uv pip install twine

# Upload to TestPyPI first
twine upload --repository testpypi target/wheels/*

# Test from TestPyPI
uv pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ market-data-source

# Upload to real PyPI
twine upload target/wheels/*
```
