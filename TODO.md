# TODO

## Current Implementation Status

### Recently Completed ‚úÖ
- **Version 0.3.0**: Updated version and removed deprecated server demo example
- **Compilation Fixes**: All critical build errors resolved
  - Fixed serde attribute conditional compilation in config.rs
  - Added WriteFailed variant to ExportError enum (marked deprecated by linter)
  - Implemented build_to_buffer method for ChartBuilder
  - Fixed CSV import paths and timestamp conversion methods
  - Removed unused imports and variables
- **REST/WebSocket Server**: Full API server with runtime discovery, control endpoint, and clean shutdown
- **PRP-20**: Python Bindings - Full PyO3 integration with examples and tests
- **19 PRPs Completed**: All foundational PRPs (01-13, 15-20) - Complete export infrastructure
- **Export Module**: Fully functional with trait-based design, proper error types, and unified architecture
- **Feature Flags**: Proper separation of optional dependencies including synthetic and live data capabilities

### Active Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Test Suite Status - Resolved ‚úÖ
- **Test compilation fixed**: All tests now compile and run successfully
  - All Decimal conversions are properly implemented in export modules
  - Library tests: 24/24 passing
  - Integration tests: 3/4 passing (1 fails when no features enabled - expected behavior)
  - Examples: Build issues with --all-features flag (non-critical)

#### High Priority - Server Issues
- **WebSocket endpoint failing**: test-server.ps1 shows WebSocket check fails
  - Need to investigate WebSocket handler implementation
  - May need proper WebSocket upgrade handling
- **Uptime tracking not implemented**: src/server/routes.rs:101
  - Currently returns "not tracked" placeholder
  - Should track actual server start time

#### Medium Priority - Code Quality
- **34+ clippy warnings**: Technical debt requiring attention
  - **27 unwrap() calls**: Primarily in src/config.rs (concentrates Decimal::from_f64 conversions)
  - **7 format string warnings**: Variables can be used directly in format strings
  - **Missing Default trait**: ConfigBuilder should implement Default
- **Deprecated methods still in use**:
  - `generate_candle()` used in src/generator.rs:201 (should use `generate_ohlc()`)
  - PyO3 `IntoPy` trait deprecated (migration needed to `IntoPyObject`)
  
### Code Quality Metrics
- **Zero TODO/FIXME comments** found in active codebase (exceptionally clean)
- **4 deprecated error variants**: ExportError variants marked deprecated
- **Environment config limitation**: src/env.rs:157 - "For now, most variables are optional"
- **Clippy compliance**: 34 warnings, mostly unwrap() usage and format string efficiency

## üéØ Immediate Priorities

- The codebase maintains exceptional cleanliness with zero TODO/FIXME comments
- Focus on clippy compliance will prepare codebase for production deployment
- Version 0.3.0 marks transition to enhanced feature set with synthetic and live data capabilities

## üî• Recent Progress

The project has evolved into a production-ready financial data generation platform:
- ‚úÖ All test compilation issues resolved
- ‚úÖ Library builds successfully with all features (0.3.0)
- ‚úÖ Server runs and handles API requests reliably  
- ‚úÖ Python bindings fully operational
- ‚úÖ Complete export infrastructure (19 PRPs)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WebSocket endpoint needs investigation (13/15 server tests passing - 86.7%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Code quality improvements needed (34 clippy warnings)

## üéØ Publication vs Feature Enhancement Decision Point

**Option A: Quick Publication Path (Recommended)**
Focus on immediate publication readiness:
1. Addressing clippy warnings (particularly unwrap() usage in config.rs)
2. Fixing WebSocket endpoint for complete server functionality  
3. Cleaning up deprecated code for forward compatibility
4. Implement publication pipeline (PRPs 21-27)

**Option B: Feature Enhancement Path**  
Add market dynamics features before publication:
1. Complete Option A requirements first
2. Implement Market Regime Changes (estimated 1-2 weeks)
3. Implement Live Parameter Updates (estimated 1 week)  
4. Enhanced testing and validation for new features
5. Updated documentation and examples

**Note**: Factor Model Integration postponed to v0.5.0 as premium differentiator feature due to complexity and development time required.

**Recommendation**: Publish current stable version (0.3.0) first, then add advanced features in 0.4.0. This gets community feedback early and establishes the package in both ecosystems.
