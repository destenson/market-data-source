All foundational work, CI/CD infrastructure, and trusted publishing completed with 26 PRPs implemented:
- Core library architecture and data types
- Comprehensive export infrastructure (CSV, JSON, PNG, CouchDB)
- Python bindings with full PyO3 integration
- REST/WebSocket server with proper API design
