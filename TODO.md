## ðŸŽ¯ KILLER FEATURE: Market Data Generation

The primary focus of v0.1.0 is providing best-in-class synthetic market data generation with unparalleled configurability and realism.

### Why This Matters - Use Cases
- **Strategy Testing**: Test trading algorithms against infinite scenarios without expensive data subscriptions
- **Risk Analysis**: Generate stress test scenarios, black swan events, and edge cases on demand
- **ML Training**: Create unlimited training data with specific market conditions for model development
- **Demo/Development**: Realistic data for demos, development, and testing without compliance concerns
- **Education**: Teach market dynamics with controllable, reproducible scenarios

### Critical - Foundation (Must have for v0.1.0)

- [x] Create library structure (convert from binary to library crate)
- [x] Define core data structures (OHLC, Tick, Volume, OrderBook snapshots)
- [x] Implement MarketDataGenerator with builder pattern API
- [x] Create GeneratorConfig struct with essential parameters
- [x] Basic random walk with drift algorithm
- [x] Unit tests (27 passing)
- [x] Working example

### Essential Generation Parameters (User-configurable)

- [ ] **Trend Control**: Direction (bull/bear/sideways), strength (% per period), custom curves
- [ ] **Volatility Control**: Standard deviation, volatility clustering, GARCH effects
- [ ] **Price Parameters**: Starting price, average price, min/max bounds, tick size
- [ ] **Time Control**: Interval (tick/1s/1m/5m/1h/1d), duration, market hours simulation
- [ ] **Volume Profiles**: Average volume, volume-price correlation, volume spikes
- [ ] **Distribution Types**: Normal, log-normal, student-t, custom fat tails

### Advanced Market Realism

- [ ] **Intraday Patterns**: Opening auction volatility, lunch-time lull, closing volatility
- [ ] **Market Microstructure**: Bid-ask spreads, order book depth, market impact
- [ ] **Event Generation**: News spikes, earnings announcements, flash crashes
- [ ] **Regime Changes**: Volatility regime switches, trend reversals, breakouts
- [ ] **Correlations**: Multi-asset correlation matrices, sector relationships
- [ ] **Anomalies**: Fat finger events, circuit breaker triggers, halts

### Generator Output Formats

- [ ] Stream API for real-time-like data generation
- [ ] Batch generation for historical data simulation  
- [ ] Multiple data formats (OHLCV, tick data, order book snapshots)
- [ ] Export to common formats (CSV, Parquet, JSON, MessagePack)
- [ ] WebSocket server mode for realistic testing environments

### Testing & Validation Tools

- [ ] Statistical validation suite (Jarque-Bera, ADF, ARCH tests)
- [ ] Visual charting tools for generated data inspection
- [ ] Comparison metrics against real market data
- [ ] Backtesting harness for strategy validation

## Version 0.2.0 and Beyond

### Real Data Integration (Lower Priority)
- [ ] Implement fetch_real_time_data method for MarketData
- [ ] Implement fetch_historical_data method for MarketData
- [ ] Add support for data sources (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.)

### Documentation & Examples for v0.1.0

- [ ] Comprehensive examples showing all generation parameters
- [ ] Cookbook with common market scenarios (bull run, crash, ranging market)
- [ ] API documentation with clear parameter descriptions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (data points per second)
- [ ] Comparison with real market data statistics

## Supporting Infrastructure

- [ ] Error handling and custom error types
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for generators
- [ ] Integration tests with various parameter combinations
- [ ] Property-based testing for statistical correctness
- [ ] Add LICENSE file (MIT)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] GPU acceleration for massive data generation
- [ ] Distributed generation for multi-asset universes  
- [ ] Machine learning-based pattern generation
- [ ] Historical event replay with variations
- [ ] Options and derivatives data generation
